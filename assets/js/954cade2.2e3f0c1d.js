This decision, driven by\\na philosophy of \\"developing in the open\\", has transformed game development into\\na shared adventure, complete with its ups, downs, and everything in between.\\n\\nThe streams have provided an opportunity not just to watch code take shape, but\\nalso to delve into the journey behind it \u2014 the planning, the challenges, the\\nbreakthroughs, and the continuous refining of our project.\\n\\nFor more on the philosophy that inspired this journey and the initial steps we\\ntook together, I invite you to revisit [my\\nannouncement](2023-06-12-broadcast-intercepted.md) from last week. Now, let\'s\\nreflect on our first week\'s milestones and look ahead to what\'s coming.\\n\\n## Celebrating Progress\\n\\nSince the launch, we\'ve accomplished an exciting number of milestones. With\\nthree successful streams under our belt and the fourth happening tonight, we\'re\\nsteadily creating a space for transparency, learning, and communal development.\\n\\nOur follower count has been steadily rising and I am humbled by the response\\nwe\'ve been receiving. The progress is palpable and we\'re moving ever closer to\\nour goal of becoming a Twitch Affiliate. The only requirement left is to\\ncontinue streaming and that\'s exactly what we plan to do.\\n\\nCommunity engagement has been nothing short of phenomenal. Every stream feels\\nlike a dialogue \u2014 a genuine conversation with those who have become as invested\\nin the development of Sentinel as I am. Every question, every suggestion, every\\nshared laugh \u2014 it all contributes to an atmosphere of collective creativity and\\ncamaraderie. I can\'t wait to engage with all of you every time I go live.\\n\\nFinally, I want to acknowledge the personal growth that this journey has\\nstimulated. Being on camera, narrating my process and my thoughts, engaging with\\nthe community \u2014 it\'s been a learning curve. It\'s an aspect of the process I\\ncontinue to adapt to and improve upon, but I am embracing the challenge and am\\neager to evolve alongside Sentinel.\\n\\nThese achievements are not just mine, but ours as a community. Here\'s to many\\nmore milestones ahead!\\n\\n## Turning Obstacles into Opportunities\\n\\nThis journey has brought with it its fair share of obstacles, but each of these\\nchallenges has been an opportunity for growth and learning.\\n\\nOur maiden stream was a crash course in adapting on the fly. We encountered a\\nfew technical problems, but rather than getting bogged down, we used this as a\\nchance to demonstrate real-world problem-solving. It was an unexpected\\nopportunity to showcase the less glamorous, yet equally important, aspects of\\ndevelopment \u2014 troubleshooting and resilience.\\n\\nBalancing time and energy among various commitments has been another significant\\nchallenge. Aligning streaming times, development hours, and personal commitments\\nis not an easy task. But this has spurred me towards a more mindful approach to\\nscheduling and the prioritization of tasks. I\'m continually learning how to\\nbetter manage my time to create a harmonious balance that benefits everyone,\\nmyself included.\\n\\nUnfortunately, health reasons led to the cancellation of one of our streams.\\nHowever, the understanding and support I received from all of you was\\noverwhelming and incredibly heartening. It served as a reminder of the\\nimportance of taking care of oneself and how integral rest is to the creative\\nprocess. We resumed right where we left off, and this only strengthened our\\nresolve to continue this exciting journey.\\n\\nThese obstacles have not been setbacks, but stepping stones towards bettering\\nmyself and improving the live stream experience for all of you.\\n\\n## What\'s on the Horizon\\n\\nAs we continue, our immediate focus is to continue pushing forward towards\\ncompleting our minimum core gameplay loop for Sentinel.\\n\\nFor those unfamiliar with game development jargon, a \\"core gameplay loop\\" refers\\nto the primary sequence of activities a player does repeatedly \u2014 in essence, the\\nmain actions and interactions that define the game. Establishing this\\nfundamental structure allows us to have a solid foundation upon which we can\\nthen iterate, refine and expand.\\n\\nIterating on the core gameplay loop is where the magic happens \u2014 this is when\\nwe\'ll test, tweak, and refine elements of the game, from balance and pacing to\\nplayer engagement and satisfaction. Each iteration gives us the chance to\\nimprove Sentinel, ensuring it\'s not just functional, but also fun, immersive and\\ncompelling.\\n\\nWhile it\'s hard to provide specifics at this stage without spoiling the\\nsurprise, you can expect continued development in various game mechanics, AI\\nbehaviors, level design, player abilities and more. I\'m eager to tackle these\\nareas in upcoming streams and engage you all in the process.\\n\\nThis is just the start of our journey, and there\'s so much more to look forward\\nto. I hope you\'re as excited about the future of Sentinel as I am!\\n\\n## Striking the Balance: Organizing Time for Better Harmony\\n\\nLife, like any good game, is about balance. The way we manage our time,\\ndistribute our energy, and align our priorities forms a complex, evolving\\nequilibrium that influences our overall well-being and effectiveness. Many call\\nthis \\"work-life balance\\", but I prefer to think of it as \\"life equilibrium\\" or\\n\\"time harmony\\".\\n\\nThe term \\"work-life balance\\" suggests an inherent opposition between work and\\nlife \u2014 as though work isn\'t a part of our lives, but rather something that takes\\naway from it. This viewpoint can foster a sense of tension and dissatisfaction,\\nas we may feel that our work hours are somehow \'lost\' or \'wasted\' time. In\\ncontrast, the concepts of \\"life equilibrium\\" and \\"time harmony\\" offer a\\nhealthier, more holistic perspective. They acknowledge that work is indeed a\\npart of our lives, and emphasize the importance of distributing our time in ways\\nthat enable us to live fully and authentically.\\n\\nIn this spirit, I\'ve decided to adjust my streaming and work schedule. The new\\nschedule not only accommodates my various commitments, but also aligns with my\\nnatural rhythms and preferences for focus and rest. I believe it will allow me\\nto bring you more engaging, energetic streams, without compromising my other\\nresponsibilities or my personal well-being.\\n\\nHere\'s what the new schedule looks like:\\n\\n- **Monday:** Stream at 1 PM CT / 6\u202fPM UTC\\n- **Tuesday:** Stream at 1 PM CT / 6\u202fPM UTC\\n- **Wednesday:** No stream. New blog post published.\\n- **Thursday:** Day off.\\n- **Friday:** Stream at 1 PM CT / 6\u202fPM UTC\\n- **Saturday:** Stream at 1 PM CT / 6\u202fPM UTC\\n- **Sunday:** No stream. New highlights video published.\\n\\nI invite you all to join me as I navigate this new schedule. Your support and\\nengagement in the live streams is not just appreciated \u2014 it\'s invaluable. You\\ncan get notified about when I go live by following me on\\n[Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/lasttalon),\\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/LastTalon),\\n[Mastodon](https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@LastTalon), and\\n[Discord](https://discord.gg/aq2UkZUWsj).

Starting\\nsoon, I\'ll be live streaming my development process on [Twitch]. This is a\\njourney I\'ve been eager to embark on, and I\'m genuinely thrilled to share it\\nwith you. In this post, I\'ll let you in on what you can expect from these live\\nstreams and why I believe this journey can be an enriching adventure for\\neveryone.\\n\\nI am excited to reveal that starting from tomorrow, Tuesday, June 13th, I\'ll be\\nopening the doors of my development process, and you\'re invited to join me.\\nYou\'ll get a front-row seat as I code, make design decisions, and tackle the\\nvery real challenges that come with software development.\\n\\nTo skip to the stream invitation, [check below](#youre-invited).\\n\\n## Description of Streaming Content\\n\\nThese live streams provide a peek inside the code editor of a developer. They\'re\\na shared journey, a platform to explore the multifaceted process of creating\\n_Sentinel_, a project that\'s very close to my heart. A development live stream\\nis an opportunity to watch a software project come to life in real-time. You\'ll\\nget to see everything: the code being written, problems being debugged, and\\nfeatures being designed and implemented.\\n\\nFor those unfamiliar with the project, _Sentinel_ is a cooperative, hero-based,\\nhorde survival game. It\'s designed for the _Roblox_ platform, targeting players\\naged 12 and above who seek a more mature, thrilling gaming experience. Drawing\\ninspiration from popular games like _Dota_ and horde survival games like\\n_Killing Floor_ or _Left 4 Dead_, _Sentinel_ is packed with exciting game modes,\\nchallenging boss battles, and a robust progression system. I genuinely believe\\nit holds the potential to become a standout title on the _Roblox_ platform.\\n\\nBut I want to give you more than just a front-row seat to coding. I want to\\nshare the full breadth of the development journey with you. True development\\ngoes beyond just writing software; it encompasses planning, iterating, refining,\\nand sometimes, starting from scratch. From setting up documentation and this\\nblog to managing our issue tracker, these streams will offer a holistic look\\ninto the development process. It\'s about laying bare the realities of creating\\nsomething from scratch, warts and all, and I couldn\'t be more excited to share\\nit with you.\\n\\n## Why Reveal My Secrets?\\n\\nWhy have I decided to broadcast my journey? There are several reasons, but they\\nall converge on a single value: openness. I am a strong believer in the\\n[philosophy](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/) of \\"developing\\nin the open.\\" This principle extends beyond just making the source code publicly\\navailable. It encompasses sharing the thought processes, the struggles, the\\neureka moments, the disappointments, and the victories that come with the\\njourney of software development. By exposing the entire lifecycle of a project,\\nwe foster a sense of authenticity, allowing for a richer learning and\\ncommunity-building experience.\\n\\nThese live streams are an extension of this belief, serving as a live\\ndocumentation of _Sentinel\'s_ development process. My hope is that these\\nsessions provide a valuable educational resource, offering a first-hand look\\ninto the nitty-gritty of developing a software project. It\'s a platform for\\nlearning, but also an invitation to join the conversation, to share insights,\\nand to learn together. This transparency isn\'t just about my growth as a\\ndeveloper, but also about helping each other grow, and learning from one\\nanother\'s experiences.\\n\\nAnd it\'s not just about learning. I believe that watching a project evolve,\\nengaging in the process, and experiencing the triumphs and challenges along the\\nway, also fosters a sense of camaraderie and community. I hope to make these\\nstreams not just informative, but also an enjoyable space where we can connect\\nover shared passions and experiences.\\n\\n## End of Transmission\\n\\nThank you all for your support and for sharing this journey with me. In these\\nstreams, you\'re not just a spectator, but an integral part of the development\\nprocess. I look forward to learning, growing, and creating with you. Who knows\\nwhere this adventure will lead us?\\n\\n## You\'re Invited\\n\\nI\'d love for you to be a part of this journey with me.
