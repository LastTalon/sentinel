Starting\\nsoon, I\'ll be live streaming my development process on [Twitch]. This is a\\njourney I\'ve been eager to embark on, and I\'m genuinely thrilled to share it\\nwith you. In this post, I\'ll let you in on what you can expect from these live\\nstreams and why I believe this journey can be an enriching adventure for\\neveryone.\\n\\nI am excited to reveal that starting from tomorrow, Tuesday, June 13th, I\'ll be\\nopening the doors of my development process, and you\'re invited to join me.\\nYou\'ll get a front-row seat as I code, make design decisions, and tackle the\\nvery real challenges that come with software development.\\n\\nTo skip to the stream invitation, [check below](#youre-invited).\\n\\n## Description of Streaming Content\\n\\nThese live streams provide a peek inside the code editor of a developer. They\'re\\na shared journey, a platform to explore the multifaceted process of creating\\n_Sentinel_, a project that\'s very close to my heart. A development live stream\\nis an opportunity to watch a software project come to life in real-time. You\'ll\\nget to see everything: the code being written, problems being debugged, and\\nfeatures being designed and implemented.\\n\\nFor those unfamiliar with the project, _Sentinel_ is a cooperative, hero-based,\\nhorde survival game. It\'s designed for the _Roblox_ platform, targeting players\\naged 12 and above who seek a more mature, thrilling gaming experience. Drawing\\ninspiration from popular games like _Dota_ and horde survival games like\\n_Killing Floor_ or _Left 4 Dead_, _Sentinel_ is packed with exciting game modes,\\nchallenging boss battles, and a robust progression system. I genuinely believe\\nit holds the potential to become a standout title on the _Roblox_ platform.\\n\\nBut I want to give you more than just a front-row seat to coding. I want to\\nshare the full breadth of the development journey with you. True development\\ngoes beyond just writing software; it encompasses planning, iterating, refining,\\nand sometimes, starting from scratch. From setting up documentation and this\\nblog to managing our issue tracker, these streams will offer a holistic look\\ninto the development process. It\'s about laying bare the realities of creating\\nsomething from scratch, warts and all, and I couldn\'t be more excited to share\\nit with you.\\n\\n## Why Reveal My Secrets?\\n\\nWhy have I decided to broadcast my journey? There are several reasons, but they\\nall converge on a single value: openness. I am a strong believer in the\\n[philosophy](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/) of \\"developing\\nin the open.\\" This principle extends beyond just making the source code publicly\\navailable. It encompasses sharing the thought processes, the struggles, the\\neureka moments, the disappointments, and the victories that come with the\\njourney of software development. By exposing the entire lifecycle of a project,\\nwe foster a sense of authenticity, allowing for a richer learning and\\ncommunity-building experience.\\n\\nThese live streams are an extension of this belief, serving as a live\\ndocumentation of _Sentinel\'s_ development process. My hope is that these\\nsessions provide a valuable educational resource, offering a first-hand look\\ninto the nitty-gritty of developing a software project. It\'s a platform for\\nlearning, but also an invitation to join the conversation, to share insights,\\nand to learn together. This transparency isn\'t just about my growth as a\\ndeveloper, but also about helping each other grow, and learning from one\\nanother\'s experiences.\\n\\nAnd it\'s not just about learning. I believe that watching a project evolve,\\nengaging in the process, and experiencing the triumphs and challenges along the\\nway, also fosters a sense of camaraderie and community. I hope to make these\\nstreams not just informative, but also an enjoyable space where we can connect\\nover shared passions and experiences.\\n\\n## End of Transmission\\n\\nThank you all for your support and for sharing this journey with me. In these\\nstreams, you\'re not just a spectator, but an integral part of the development\\nprocess. I look forward to learning, growing, and creating with you. Who knows\\nwhere this adventure will lead us?\\n\\n## You\'re Invited\\n\\nI\'d love for you to be a part of this journey with me.
