Hello there, friend.

If you've been following along with my project, _Sentinel_, you might be
interested to hear that I've decided to take things in a new direction. Starting
soon, I'll be live streaming my development process on [Twitch]. This is a
journey I've been eager to embark on, and I'm genuinely thrilled to share it
with you. In this post, I'll let you in on what you can expect from these live
streams and why I believe this journey can be an enriching adventure for
everyone.

I am excited to reveal that starting from tomorrow, Tuesday, June 13th, I'll be
opening the doors of my development process, and you're invited to join me.
You'll get a front-row seat as I code, make design decisions, and tackle the
very real challenges that come with software development.

To skip to the stream invitation, [check below](#youre-invited).

## Description of Streaming Content

These live streams provide a peek inside the code editor of a developer. They're
a shared journey, a platform to explore the multifaceted process of creating
_Sentinel_, a project that's very close to my heart. A development live stream
is an opportunity to watch a software project come to life in real-time. You'll
get to see everything: the code being written, problems being debugged, and
features being designed and implemented.

For those unfamiliar with the project, _Sentinel_ is a cooperative, hero-based,
horde survival game. It's designed for the _Roblox_ platform, targeting players
aged 12 and above who seek a more mature, thrilling gaming experience. Drawing
inspiration from popular games like _Dota_ and horde survival games like
_Killing Floor_ or _Left 4 Dead_, _Sentinel_ is packed with exciting game modes,
challenging boss battles, and a robust progression system. I genuinely believe
it holds the potential to become a standout title on the _Roblox_ platform.

But I want to give you more than just a front-row seat to coding. I want to
share the full breadth of the development journey with you. True development
goes beyond just writing software; it encompasses planning, iterating, refining,
and sometimes, starting from scratch. From setting up documentation and this
blog to managing our issue tracker, these streams will offer a holistic look
into the development process. It's about laying bare the realities of creating
something from scratch, warts and all, and I couldn't be more excited to share
it with you.

## Why Reveal My Secrets?

Why have I decided to broadcast my journey? There are several reasons, but they
all converge on a single value: openness. I am a strong believer in the
[philosophy](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/) of "developing
in the open." This principle extends beyond just making the source code publicly
available. It encompasses sharing the thought processes, the struggles, the
eureka moments, the disappointments, and the victories that come with the
journey of software development. By exposing the entire lifecycle of a project,
we foster a sense of authenticity, allowing for a richer learning and
community-building experience.

These live streams are an extension of this belief, serving as a live
documentation of _Sentinel's_ development process. My hope is that these
sessions provide a valuable educational resource, offering a first-hand look
into the nitty-gritty of developing a software project. It's a platform for
learning, but also an invitation to join the conversation, to share insights,
and to learn together. This transparency isn't just about my growth as a
developer, but also about helping each other grow, and learning from one
another's experiences.

And it's not just about learning. I believe that watching a project evolve,
engaging in the process, and experiencing the triumphs and challenges along the
way, also fosters a sense of camaraderie and community. I hope to make these
streams not just informative, but also an enjoyable space where we can connect
over shared passions and experiences.

## End of Transmission

Thank you all for your support and for sharing this journey with me. In these
streams, you're not just a spectator, but an integral part of the development
process. I look forward to learning, growing, and creating with you. Who knows
where this adventure will lead us?
