**Sentinel** is a _[Roblox]_ game written using [roblox-ts].

Sentinel is a hero-based, wave horde survival game. More information to come.

## Building

Sentinel is built by compiling it with [roblox-ts]. Additionally it will need
all of its depencencies installed from `package.json`.

You can then sync or build the project with [Rojo]. Sentinel contains several
project files with different builds of the project. The `default.project.json`
is the production build.

The `package.json` contains a number of scripts for automating these processes.
